## Weather Data ETL Pipeline Using Apache Airflow & Docker
Project Overview
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for weather data using Apache Airflow and Docker. The pipeline will fetch weather data from an API, transform the data (e.g., cleaning, parsing, and aggregating), and load it into a target database (e.g., PostgreSQL). The use of Docker containers ensures that the pipeline runs in an isolated, reproducible environment.

Key Features
Extract: Fetch weather data from a public weather API .

Transform: Clean and process the raw data, including filtering, converting units, and handling missing values.

Load: Store the processed data into a database, such as PostgreSQL or a data warehouse.

Automation: The ETL pipeline is managed and automated with Apache Airflow, enabling scheduling, retries, and logging.

Dockerization: All components are containerized using Docker, making the setup portable and easy to deploy.

Prerequisites
Python (>= 3.8)

Apache Airflow

Docker (for containerizing the environment)

PostgreSQL (or another database of your choice)

Access to a Weather API (OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, etc.)

Setup & Installation
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-etl-pipeline.git
cd weather-etl-pipeline
### 2. Install Docker
If you haven't installed Docker yet, download and install it from Docker's official website.

### 3. Docker Compose for Development Environment
The project comes with a docker-compose.yml file that will set up the necessary containers, including Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL.

To build and start the containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
This will start the following services:

Apache Airflow (with web UI accessible at localhost:8080)

PostgreSQL database (used for storing weather data)


Replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key from the weather provider.
### 4. Running Apache Airflow
Once your containers are up and running, go to the Airflow web UI (http://localhost:8080). The default login is:

Username: airflow

Password: airflow

You can then trigger your DAG manually or wait for the scheduled execution.

### 5. DAG Configuration
The main ETL logic is contained within the Apache Airflow DAG. The DAG is responsible for:

Extracting weather data from the weather API.

Transforming the data.

Loading the transformed data into the PostgreSQL database.

### 6. Scheduling & Automation
The DAG is scheduled to run at a specified interval (e.g., every day). You can modify the scheduling in the Airflow web UI or by editing the schedule_interval parameter in the weather_etl.py file.

### 7. Monitoring
Apache Airflow provides detailed logging for monitoring the progress of each task in the ETL pipeline. You can access these logs from the Airflow web UI.

Usage
Running the ETL Pipeline
Once everything is set up, the ETL pipeline will run according to the schedule set in the Airflow DAG. You can also manually trigger the pipeline from the Airflow web UI.

Accessing Data
After the pipeline runs, the transformed weather data will be loaded into the PostgreSQL database. You can query the database to explore the data:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM weather_data;
Technologies Used
Apache Airflow: Orchestrates and automates the ETL process.

Docker: Used for containerizing the services (Airflow, PostgreSQL).

PostgreSQL: Database for storing the weather data.

Weather API: External API for retrieving weather data 

Python: Programming language for developing the ETL pipeline.
