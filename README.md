**Airflow ETL Pipeline Project**

This project implements an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data. 
The pipeline processes data from multiple sources, transforms it, and loads it into a target system. The project is containerized 
using Docker for easy deployment and management.

## Technologies Used
- Apache Airflow
- Docker
- Python
- PostgreSQL (or any other database you're using)
- (Any other tools you may have used, such as Astronomer, Kubernetes, etc.)

Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airflow-etl-project.git
   cd airflow-etl-project
   ```

**2. Set up the environment:**
   - Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
     
**3. Run the Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

**4. Access Airflow UI:**
   - Once the containers are up, access the Airflow web UI by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

**5. Access PostgreSQL database (if needed):**
   - The PostgreSQL service is available on port `5432`.

**6. Running DAGs:**
- Once Airflow is up and running, the DAGs will be automatically triggered according to their schedule.
   - You can also manually trigger the DAGs from the Airflow UI.

**How to Use the Project**
- The project includes several Airflow DAGs (Direct Acyclic Graphs) that automate different ETL processes.
- Each DAG is responsible for extracting data from a source, transforming it, and loading it into a target system.
- You can monitor the execution of these tasks in the Airflow web UI.
- You can trigger, pause, or inspect the tasks as needed.

Example DAGs:
- `etl_data_pipeline`: Extracts data from Source A, transforms it, and loads it into the Target system.
- `backup_database`: Periodically backs up the database.

```

Configuration

- The Airflow setup uses environment variables stored in the `.env` file for configuration.
- You can modify these variables to configure the database connection, Airflow scheduler settings, etc.
- Example `.env` file:
  ```env
  AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/db_name
  ```

  - For PostgreSQL:
    - Username: `user`
    - Password: `password`
    - Database Name: `airflow_db`

**Running Tests**

If you have tests for your project, you can run them with the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
This will discover and run all test files in the `tests/` directory.

**Open Weather API's**: Airpollution api is used to fetch the data for the selected latitude and longitude.So for the accessing of the data or extract the you need the lat,long and api key
